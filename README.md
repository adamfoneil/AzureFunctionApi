All of my Blazor work has been in the Server-hosted model, but I want to get into WebAssembly, because I think this is ultimately where I should be heading. The main reasons are to open my work to cheaper hosting models and to expand my overall reach in the Blazor space. By targeting WebAssembly, I could host apps on as a static site, then use Azure Functions as the backend. This is much more cost effective than Azure App Service I believe.

The goal for this repo, therefore, is to work out the Azure Function integration in terms of an [HttpCrudClient](https://github.com/adamfoneil/HttpData/blob/master/HttpData.Client/HttpCrudClient.cs) and [HttpCrudServer](https://github.com/adamfoneil/HttpData/blob/master/HttpData.Server/HttpCrudServer.cs). I've done a lot of work in the relational data access space (via Dapper), and this is the first time I've really considered decoupling from that to some degree. I still envision relational data access in the backend, but WASM apps won't make a direct database connection like Server-based apps do. So, this requires some different thinking to some degree, but I still put a merciless emphasis on convention, simplicity, and testability. I still have an extremely low tolerance for boilerplate and "because someone said so" best practice.
